name: simplecolor
summary: "Simple color library"
description: "A simple library for coloring text output. Heavily inspired
  from term-ansicolor and rainbow, I recommend using these gems for more
  complex color needs. By default this gem does not do any core extension.
  When mixed in String it only add two methods: color and uncolored. Paint
  is another gem similar to this one, but with more powerfull shortcuts
  definitions."
